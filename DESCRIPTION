Description: An implementation of a hierarchical semi-mechanistic renewal
    approach jointly calibrating to multiple wastewater concentrations datasets from
    subsets of a specified population and epidemioliogical indicators such as cases
    or hospital admissions from the whole population. Our framework is an extension
    of the widely used semi-mechanistic renewal framework EpiNow2, using a Bayesian
    latent variable approach implemented in the probabilistic programming language
    Stan. This package contains just the core components needed to fit these two
    data sources and produce the following outputs-- estimated and forecasted
    hospital admissions, estimated and forecasted wastewater concentrations,
    global R(t) estimates, local R(t) estimates for the subpopulations
    represented by each wastewater catchment area. For an evaluation of the
    model's performance on forecasting COVID-19 hospital admissions in real-time
    and retrospectively, with and without wastewater and compared to other COVID
    forecasting models during the 2023-2024 season, please see our recent
    pre-print Johnson(2026) <https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.23.26346887>.
